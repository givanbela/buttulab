# buttulab
ButtuLab is a virtual lab with a real location: the birthplace of the composer Franti≈°ek Buttula. Anyone can enter or stay at home and organize initiatives with art, science, technology as long as the outcome is ecological. It is also dynamically distributed: all participants can create a kind of buttulab branch, the more the merrier, as long as it is accessible to audience and creators. Everyone can be a creator. Maybe each participant should keep its branch as unique and independent as possible, and only merge common features...
